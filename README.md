# Neural Network-Based Option Pricing Using Black-Scholes Model

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a neural network to predict European call option prices based on the Black-Scholes model. We generate synthetic options data and calculate option prices and their Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta) using the Black-Scholes formula. A neural network is then trained to predict the option prices, and the model's performance is evaluated against both the original Black-Scholes prices and noisy market data to investigate potential market inefficiencies.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Generate Synthetic Options Data Using Black-Scholes Formula
**Objective:** Generate synthetic options data to simulate call and put option prices.  
**Implementation:**
- Implemented functions for calculating the Black-Scholes European call and put option prices.
- Calculated Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta) for each option based on the input parameters: stock price (S), strike price (K), time to maturity (T), risk-free interest rate (r), and volatility (sigma).  
**Outcome:** Successfully generated synthetic options data with corresponding prices and Greeks.

### 2. Prepare the Dataset
**Objective:** Organize and standardize data for training a neural network model.  
**Implementation:**
- Created a DataFrame with features including stock price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and option Greeks.
- Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y), where the target is the call price.
- Performed data splitting into training and testing sets and standardized the features using `StandardScaler`.  
**Outcome:** Data prepared for training the neural network.

### 3. Build and Train the Neural Network
**Objective:** Train a neural network model to predict the European call option price.  
**Implementation:**
- Built a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras with two hidden layers of 64 units each and ReLU activation.
- Compiled the model using mean squared error as the loss function and Adam optimizer.
- Trained the model on the standardized training data for 50 epochs with batch size of 32.  
**Outcome:** Successfully trained the neural network to predict option prices.

### 4. Evaluate the Model
**Objective:** Evaluate the model's performance on test data.  
**Implementation:**
- Predicted call option prices using the trained neural network on the test set.
- Calculated the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) values to evaluate the model’s performance.  
**Outcome:** The model achieved a good fit with the test data, showing a reasonable MSE and R² score.

### 5. Compare the Model's Predictions to the Black-Scholes Model
**Objective:** Compare the model’s predicted option prices with the original Black-Scholes prices.  
**Implementation:**
- Since the synthetic data was generated using the Black-Scholes model, the residuals (differences between actual and predicted prices) were analyzed.
- Plotted the residuals distribution and a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted option prices.  
**Outcome:** The residuals showed a normal distribution, and the scatter plot indicated good prediction accuracy.

### 6. Investigate Market Inefficiencies with Noisy Data
**Objective:** Introduce noise into the option prices to simulate market data and retrain the model.  
**Implementation:**
- Added random noise to the call prices to simulate real-world market data.
- Retrained the model using the noisy data and evaluated the performance using MSE and R².
- Analyzed residuals and plotted a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices on the noisy data.  
**Outcome:** The model showed a slight decrease in performance on noisy data, but still provided reasonably accurate predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of neural networks for option pricing, using synthetic data generated by the Black-Scholes model. By training a neural network on this data and comparing its predictions with the theoretical Black-Scholes prices, the project explores the potential of machine learning in financial modeling. Introducing noise into the data mimics market inefficiencies, allowing the investigation of how well the model adapts to real-world data variability.
